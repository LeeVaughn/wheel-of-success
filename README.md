# Wheel of Success
In the spirit of the Wheel of Fortune game, guess the hidden phrase before you run out of lives.

## Features

* If the selected letter is in the phrase it will be revealed.
* If the selected letter is not in the phrase the player will lose one life.
* The player starts with five lives, as shown by the heart images at the bottom.
* The player wins if they uncover all of the letters in the phrase.
* The player loses if they run out of lives.
* At the conclusion of the game a screen will notify the player if they won or lost and allow them to play again.
